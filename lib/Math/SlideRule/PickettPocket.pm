=head1 NAME

Math::SlideRule::PickettPocket - N 3P-ES pocket slide rule

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Approximate a N 3P-ES pocket slide rule.

    use Math::SlideRule::PickettPocket;
    my $sr = Math::SlideRule::PickettPocket->new();

    $sr->divide(75, 92);
    $sr->multiply(-1.1, 2.2, -3.3, 4.4);
    ... (and etc. see Math::SlideRule)

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A Pickett Model N 3P-ES pocket slide rule implementation, primarily in the
custom L<round()> method that approximates with C<sprintf()> what a human can
do, in particular higher resolutions for lower numbers. Only "halfway between"
the tick marks is supported; a human might do better with making 9.99 line up a
skosh off the 10 tick.

Otherwise, consult L<Math::SlideRule> for the available attributes and methods
and so forth.

=head2 Known Issues

No known issues. Probably lots. (But hardly anything is implemented, so that's
probably a big issue.)
