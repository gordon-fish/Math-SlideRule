# ATTRIBUTES
#
# There used to be C/D 'has' for the value those might be set to on the
# rule, though if one adds the full set from just my rule--square root even
# digits, square root odd digits, K, A, B, ST, S, T (twice), CI, C, D, DI,
# three more for doing cube roots, plus 11 mostly log related scales on the
# flip side--updating all of these as appropriate when any one attribute
# changes: yeah, no. So the C/D were removed.

#
# METHODS

# Division is just multiplication done backwards on a slide rule, as the same
# physical distances are involved. There are also "CF" and "CI" (C scale,
# folded, or inverse) and so forth scales to assist with such operations,
# though these help avoid excess motions on the slide rule.
#
# NOTE cannot just pass m*(1/n) to multiply() because that looses precision:
# .82 for 75/92 while can get .815 on pocket slide rule.

=head1 NAME

Math::SlideRule - slide rule support for Perl

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Simulate an analog computer (without much nuance).

*** BETA interface, may change without warning ***

    use Math::SlideRule;

    my $sr = Math::SlideRule->new();

    $sr->round(1.234); # 1.23 via sprintf()

    # scientific notation breakdown
    $sr->standard_form(1234); # [ 1.234, 3 ]

    $sr->divide(75, 92);
    $sr->multiply(1.5, 3.7);
    $sr->multiply(-1.1, 2.2, -3.3, 4.4);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Slide rule support for Perl. More rounding than perhaps is necessary is the
main feature of this module. L<Math::SlideRule::PickettPocket> approximates a N
3P-ES pocket slide rule.

=head1 METHODS

Calls will C<croak> or C<die> if something goes awry.

C<round> rounds the input number via C<sprintf>. It should be overridden in any
subclasses to suit the particulars of the slide rule being implemented.
Otherwise is mostly used internally.

C<standard_form> returns a number as a list consisting of the characteristic
and exponent of that number. Mostly used internally by various other routines.

C<multiply> requires two (or more) numbers, multiples them, returns result.
There's a C<divide> as well. (There is no support for the combined
multiplication and division tricks possible on a slide rule.)

=head1 BUGS

=head2 Reporting Bugs

If the bug is in the latest version, send a report to the author.
Patches that fix problems or add new features are welcome.

L<http://rt.cpan.org/NoAuth/ReportBug.html?Queue=Math-SlideRule>

L<http://github.com/thrig/Math-SlideRule>

=head2 Known Issues

C<round> will need to be modified to specify what sort of rounding need be
done, as the various scales have various resolutions possible (and may vary by
the number under consideration, as square roots divide the scale into two, and
cube roots that same space into three).

A more realistic implementation might use XS, and C<malloc> a large amount of
contiguous memory, and then "slide" pointers around therein to represent where
the slider and hairline are. The scales would be mapped into this region of
memory, so that address C<0x0> would be C<1> of the D scale, and the highest
memory address 10 of that scale, and the other values laid out as appropriate
between those posts. With a large amount of memory, suitable resolution might
be gained, though rounding would be necessary for the many results that would
fall into memory addresses not associated with some tick mark of the scale in
question. (That the slider needs be movable and therefore the mapping of any
scales on it might be tricky?)
