=head1 NAME

Math::SlideRule - slide rule support for Perl

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Simulate an analog computer.

*** BETA interface, may change without warning ***

    use Math::SlideRule;

    my $sr = Math::SlideRule->new();

    # set where the slide rule is (these don't do much, and are at
    # present not linked as things on the slider bit would be)
    $sr->C(1.5);
    $sr->D(3.7);

    $sr->round(1.234); # 1.23 via sprintf()

    # scientific notation breakdown
    $sr->standard_form(1234); # [ 1.234, 3 ]

    # these set ->C, ->D, handle the tricky decimals, etc.
    $sr->divide(75, 92);
    $sr->multiply(1.5, 3.7);
    $sr->multiply(-1.1, 2.2, -3.3, 4.4);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Slide rule support for Perl. The abbreviated slide rule names (short letter
names like C, D, etc.) are retained as attributes (though do not do much).
Rounding is performed on the input and output values.

Certain slide rule realities are skipped, such as left versus right sliding
based on whether the result stays within the same order of magnitude: C<1.1 *
2.5> and C<4.1 * 3.7> require opposite sliding directions to compute, and one
requires more management of the decimal.

L<Math::SlideRule::PickettPocket> approximates a N 3P-ES pocket slide rule.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

Calls will C<croak> or C<die> if something goes awry.

C<C>, C<D>, and C<clear_*> to hold values for particular slide rule lookups, or
to clear such. Largely irrelevant? (Used by C<multiply> and other methods.)

=head1 METHODS

C<round> rounds the input number via C<sprintf>. It should be overridden in any
subclasses to suit the particulars of the slide rule being implemented.
Otherwise is mostly used internally.

C<standard_form> returns a number as a list consisting of the characteristic
and exponent of that number. Mostly used internally by various other routines.

C<multiply> requires two (or more) numbers, multiples them, returns result.
There's a C<divide> as well, though that only takes two numbers. (There is no
support for the combined multiplication and division tricks possible on a
slide rule.)

=head1 BUGS

=head2 Reporting Bugs

If the bug is in the latest version, send a report to the author.
Patches that fix problems or add new features are welcome.

L<http://rt.cpan.org/NoAuth/ReportBug.html?Queue=Math-SlideRule>

=head2 Known Issues

No known issues. Probably lots. (But hardly anything is implemented, so that's
probably a big issue.)
